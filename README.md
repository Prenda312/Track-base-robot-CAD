To view the final assembly, please open assembly V3.SLDASM. This CAD model represents a track-based colon endoscopic robot equipped with depth perception stereo cameras. Due to the colon's limited space, the robot’s design prioritizes a simple and efficient drive mechanism.

The TSER (Track-based Stereo Endoscopic Robot) uses a worm gear drive, widely adopted in endoscopic robots for its 90° power transmission, allowing motors to align with the robot’s body and minimize overall size. This mechanism also enables a single worm gear to drive multiple wheels, increasing contact with the colon wall while reducing drive failure risks.

Inspired by prior designs, our TSER optimizes size and reliability by relocating tracks to the corners of the robot, maximizing contact with the colon wall and maintaining movement consistency even in challenging orientations. The robot’s symmetrical design allows it to maintain traction and remain operational, even after flipping, through carefully angled tracks that enhance mobility without increasing size.

The TSER structure features rectilinear movement and two degrees of freedom driven by two motors, each with a reduction ratio of 136. The drive force is efficiently transferred to timing pulleys, ensuring compact dimensions. To manage axial forces from the worm gear, a thrust ball bearing supports stability and protects the motor.

To avoid damage to colonic tissue, the PDMS track is biocompatible, with micro-patterned surfaces to increase friction. All prototype parts were manufactured using 3D printing: the shell was created using SLA technology, while precise drive components were fabricated with multi-jet printing
